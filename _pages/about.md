I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (known as [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)), Tsinghua University. My research interest lies in cryptography and, more broadly, in theoretical computer science. I am currently interested in the following problems/areas:

- Fiat-Shamir for arguments and its applications

- PPAD (in fact, CLS) hardness from cryptographic assumptions (e.g. LWE)

- TFNP and its connection to proof complexity (see, e.g., [this workshop](https://derezende.github.io/focs21proofcomplexity/index.html))

I am also quite interested in algorithms and programming, and I used to take part in programming contests. (But I seldom need to write codes while working on theoretical computer science :-)
