In my spare time, I like playing badminton, tennis, and table tennis (all are ball sports with nets). [Here](http://qwertyzyding.github.io/images/activity1.jpg) is a picture when I took part in the IIIS tennis club activity.

I began playing billiards after taking the billiards course in my junior year, but I'm not particularly good at it. Also, I became interested in Texas hold'em after taking the game theory course (not play very well, too).
